# An implementation of Bresenham's algorithm
This algorithm draws a line between the points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1), and exports an image of it. 

It's possible to choose the colour of the line among these ones : red, green, blue, black, white, lightgray

The canvas has a size of 1000 * 1000. Coordinates are integers

# Execution
Output image must be in ppm format \
Arguments : output path, colour, x0, y0, x1, y1

# Example

The line was drawn between (250, 250) and (900, 800)
